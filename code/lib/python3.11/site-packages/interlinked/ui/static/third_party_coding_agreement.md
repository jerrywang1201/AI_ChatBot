These terms govern your use of third-party models (e.g. Claude, Gemini) listed [here](https://genai.apple.com/models/) for code generation  and  modification,  whether  via  chat  interface,  tools,  or  API.  They  apply  whether you’re  developing  code  for  internal  use  or  code  that  ships  outside  Apple  in  source  or compiled form.

Some  organizations  within  Apple  may  have  additional  restrictions  beyond  this  agreement. Please check your organization’s additional policy [here](https://genai.apple.com/coding/orgs/). Some models are also restricted to use from certain countries and regions; see details [here](https://genai.apple.com/regions/).

## No Critical source code

Because these models are hosted outside of Apple’s data centers, there are restrictions on what code may be sent in prompts and context. We have defined a new category of code called _[Critical](https://genai.apple.com/coding/critical/)_ that is vital to Apple and **MUST NOT** be sent to these systems. Only a small subset of Apple’s most  important source code is designated as Critical. You can identify critical code by the presence of a `CRITICAL` file in the root of the repository; see [here](https://genai.apple.com/coding/critical/) for more details.

## Access only via Floodgate

The models **MUST** only be accessed through the [Floodgate proxy](https://genai.apple.com/floodgate/). Using the models via their public APIs (e.g. direct to Anthropic’s servers) or via other intermediate services (e.g. Cursor) is prohibited. The proxy implements a de facto standards-compatible API to allow many client applications to work with only a change in API endpoint. Access through the proxy is logged and monitored for AI safety issues, abuse, and violations of Apple’s policies.

Models hosted and used on the same device **MAY** be accessed without use of the proxy, as long as the generated code never ships outside Apple in source or compiled form. All requirements here other than proxy use still apply.

## Human review is required

Similar to code written without AI, code written with the models **MUST** be human reviewed and controlled by you, peer reviewed, and tested. As needed, the code must also be edited, modified, rearranged, enhanced, and/or combined with other code written by Apple engineers, such that the final code and its arrangement reflects your creativity.

## Respect Apple’s policies

The models **MUST NOT** be used to generate code that violates intellectual property rights, Apple’s [security](https://genai.apple.com/coding/security/) or [open source](https://genai.apple.com/coding/open-source/) policies, or Apple’s standard best coding practices for quality, functionality, and accuracy.

Any use of the models that is not described above **MUST** be reviewed before such use by legal at [Third Party Models Request](https://jira.corp.apple.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/26/create/306).
