# Overview

This package provides a Python client API to parts of the Radar REST web service.
It lets you create, read, and change Radars from your Python command line scripts
and web applications.

Refer to the [online documentation][1] for installation instructions, getting started
tips, author contact/Slack information, API reference documentation, and more. If
it is unavailable for some reason, you can also view ``docs/index.rst``.
